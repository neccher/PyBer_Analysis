# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
V. Isualize wanted to look into the the performance of each city type.  By computing some basic summary statistics, we were able to easily compare the total rides, drivers, and fares, as well as the average fare per ride and average fare per driver for all three types.  She then asked to look into the weekly fare of each type for the first four months of 2019 and, ultimately, plot the findings in a multiple line graph.  This all was performed in the hoped that it would lead to more informed business decisions to address the disparities between the city types.

## Results
When we look at the summary of the PyBer data, we can see the city type has a significant influence on every metric we measured.

Total rides, drivers, and fares all increase as we go from rural areas to more urban ones.  From Rural to Suburban areas, the total fares increase by 347% and from Rural to Urban areas, the same metric increases by 821%!.  Even when moving from Suburban types to Urban, all three metrics at least doubled.  When averaging these statistics, we observe the opposite effect.  The average fare per driver and average fare per ride both decrease as we move from Rural to Urban.  This is due to the total fares, although they still increase moving from Rural to Urban areas, increase at a slower rate when compared to the total rides and drivers' increases.

Moving on to the weekly performance by city type, our visualization confirms our expectations of Urban cities outperforming their counterparts.
